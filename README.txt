This is a very simple REST API that returns a fibonacci number given an index or position.
I opted to do it in node using express since I have used them in the past and Javascript is my favoite language.
For a second version I would like to find a most optimized way to calculate the fibonacci number, maybe a way to return it that allows for
bigger numbers, and a more explicit way of communicating each possible error.
I believe thats about it, it was a very easy task since all I needed to do is expect a parameter, calculate the output and send it back as a json.

The README file is for you to describe your thought process. You can document: technical decisions that you made, what optimizations you could add in the 
future to improve upon your initial solution, and anything else you would like to add for us to get a better understanding of your engineering thinking.
